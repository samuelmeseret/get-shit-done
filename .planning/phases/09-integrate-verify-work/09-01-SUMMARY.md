# Phase 9 Plan 1: GSD-Compliant Verify-Work Foundation Summary

**Workflow, template, and refactored command for UAT testing with phase-scoped issue logging**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-08T14:55:24Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-08T14:58:12Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Created verify-work workflow with GSD-compliant XML structure (terse step names, prompt user pattern)
- Created UAT issues template for phase-scoped issue tracking
- Refactored verify-work command to delegate to workflow (no inline logic)

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Create verify-work workflow** - `a9a9eff` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create UAT issues template** - `654b066` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Refactor verify-work command** - `e5624d3` (refactor)

**Plan metadata:** (pending)

## Files Created/Modified

- `get-shit-done/workflows/verify-work.md` - UAT workflow with 8 terse steps
- `get-shit-done/templates/uat-issues.md` - Phase-scoped issue format with severity guide
- `commands/gsd/verify-work.md` - Refactored to delegate to workflow

## Decisions Made

- Phase-scoped issues (`{phase}-{plan}-ISSUES.md`) rather than global `ISSUES.md` — keeps UAT findings tied to specific work
- UAT- prefix for numbering — distinguishes from ISS- enhancement issues
- Per-file numbering (UAT-001, UAT-002) — no global sequence needed

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- verify-work workflow ready for use
- Next: Create `/gsd:plan-fix` command to complete verify → fix loop
- README.md update needed to document new commands
