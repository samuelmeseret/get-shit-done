# Phase 10 Plan 02: Create Parallel Execution Workflow Summary

**Created execute-phase.md workflow with 9 steps for intelligent parallelization: dependency analysis, wave calculation, parallel agent spawning via subagent, and orchestrator commit handling**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 15 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-12T18:51:58Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-12T19:07:23Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1 (created)

## Accomplishments
- Created 956-line execute-phase.md workflow with complete parallel execution logic
- Implemented dependency analysis with frontmatter + `<files>` extraction and topological sort
- Built wave-based execution model (Wave 1 parallel, Wave 2+ waits for dependencies)
- Added parallel agent spawning with subagent run_in_background, XML prompt format
- Implemented monitor_parallel_completion with check agent status polling and dependent spawning
- Added orchestrator_commit with merge conflict detection failsafe

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create execute-phase.md workflow structure** - `af7720c` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Implement dependency analysis step** - `caf2810` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Implement parallel spawning and monitoring** - `511def7` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** TBD (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md` - New workflow for parallel phase execution (956 lines)

## Decisions Made
- Agents don't commit - orchestrator collects all changes and commits per-plan in order
- Wave-based topological sort for dependency ordering
- Merge conflict detection as failsafe (dependency analysis should prevent, but edge cases exist)
- PARALLEL_AGENT_COMPLETE report format for structured agent output parsing

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## Next Phase Readiness
- Ready for 10-03-PLAN.md (create execute-phase command + config)
- execute-phase.md workflow complete with all 9 steps
- Parallelization config schema defined in workflow (to be formalized in templates/config.json)
